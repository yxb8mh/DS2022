## Forks

Once you have forked this repository, you have two options for keeping your fork current with new changes added to the original repository:

### Update your fork with the GitHub UI

1. Find the "Sync Fork" button on the main page of your fork in GitHub.
2. Within the drop-down menu, click on "Update Branch" to incorporate all upstream changes.

### Update your fork with the CLI

To stay current with new releases into the course repository, follow these steps:

1. Add an upstream source
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/uvasds-systems/ds2002-course.git
```
2. Fetch from the upstream branch:
```
git fetch upstream
```
3. Merge your branch with the upstream branch.
```
git merge upstream/main main
```

This can be run in a single block:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/uvasds-systems/ds2002-course.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main main
```

This will pull all upstream changes in and merge them with your fork. Note that the first line is a one-time configuration, whereas lines 2 and 3 can be used repeatedly to catch up with the upstream source.
